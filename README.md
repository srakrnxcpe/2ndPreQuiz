# Second Prequiz by @srakrn

## Filenames
* `projection.cs` for question A
* `math.cs` for question B
* `tax.cs` for question C
* `base.cs` for question D

## Notes
* The first problem, `projection`, could be calculated with differentation. `d/dx(ax^2+bx+c) = 2ax+b = 0`, since `x=-2a/b`.
* `math.cs` file has comment in the very beginning, which is worth reading.
